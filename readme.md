# Sinatra Web App Template

It does all the things! Are you tired of mkdiring and touching every folder and file you need just to forget the config.ru file and have your app crash and burn on heroku? I was too! This sinatra builder app generates templates for all the basic neccessary pieces of your web app!

Pull requests and forks are encouranged! This is just a template but feel free to fork this repository and edit the script with the basic code that best suits your needs. And if I missed something, let me know! 

### Prerequisites

* Mac
* Ruby 
* Bundler

### Installing

First, clone the repository to your machine. Next, navigate to the folder containing 'sinatra_builder.rb'. Lastly, run the ruby file in your terminal window with the command $ruby sinatra_builder.rb.

There is only one question! What do you want your project to be named?

The script will build your app on the desktop of your machine and run bundler for all your app dependencies!

Don't forget to 'git init'!
